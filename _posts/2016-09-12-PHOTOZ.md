## 1. <ins>An introduction to spectroscopic redshift</ins>

In the age of deep and wide-field transient surveys new transient sources are being discovered at an unprecidented rate. This rate is expected to increase again when next generation facilities, such as the Ruben Observatory, come online.

A key piece of information to have for every transient source is its redshift (or the redshift of its host galaxy), which can be used to calculate the distance to the object. Due to the expansion of the universe photons from distant objects are 'stretched' as they travel to us, causing their wavelength to increase (pushing them towards the red end of the spectrum, hence the term redshift). High resolution spectrographs, which measure the intensity of light of each wavelength, can then measure the wavelength offset of prominent emission or absorption features (casued by atomic or molecular transitions) as compared to those measured on Earth. The size of the offsetallows for a measurement of the redshift (and then a distance). A schematic demonstrating the effect of redshift on a spectrum is shown in Figure 1. 



Due to the aformentioned number of new sources being discovered it has become unfeasible to obtain spectra for all targets of interest due to the time-on-source to achieve a spectrum of sufficient quality.
