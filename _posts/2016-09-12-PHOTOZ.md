In the age of deep and wide-field transient surveys new transient sources are being discovered at an unprecidented rate. This rate is expected to increase again when next generation facilities, such as the Ruben Observatory, come online.

A key piece of intermation to have for every transient source is its redshift, which can be used to calculate the distance to the object. This can be found from the obtaining spectra of either the transient itself or its host galaxy.
