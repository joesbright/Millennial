Most stars exist in binary systems, with two stars orbiting their common center of mass. Once one of these stars evolves off of the main sequenece it will explode in a supernova explosion and, depending on the stellar mass, form a compact object (either a neutron star or a black hole). The extreme gravitational fields surrounding compact objects, along with orbital evolution in e.g. a common envelope phase, can lead to a scenario where the compact object siphons off material from the other star in the binary system. This material forms a structure around the compact object known as an accretion disk, which is a natural shape considering that the angular momentum of the infalling material must be preserved.
