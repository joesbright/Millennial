I am an experienced radio astronomer, having observed with and obtained observing time on many different instruments. I also have experience reducing and imaging radio data for scientific projects and have employed advanced calibration techniques (third generation calibration) to exploit wide field instruments such as the SKA pathfinder MeerKAT.

## Arcminute Microkelvin Imager Large Array
During my PhD I was an extensive user of the Arcminute Microkelvin Imager Larger Array (AMI-LA) located at The Mullard Radio Astronomy Observatory in Cambridge, UK. I used the AMI-LA to perform follow-up of transient events (primarily GRBs, TDEs, XRBs, SNe) and was responsible for calibrating and imaging 1000s of observing hours from the array. Additionally, I was the primary scheduler for the AMI-LA for one year during my PhD.
